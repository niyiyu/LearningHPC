# LearningHPC

This repository contains several toy programs for freshman to learn basic High Performance Computing (HPC). Possible libraries may contain:

- Massage Passing Interface, Open-MPI
- Math Kernel Library, MKL
- MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver, [MUMPS](http://mumps.enseeiht.fr)

## Note

Although each folder/example contains a Makefile, it's almost impossible to build the program with this default configuration. Check the Makefile meticulously, as well as the compile environment.
